We live in the kingdom of bullshit!!!

People are not good@abd.com to eachother

Mind awake
body@gmail.com asleep 

Mind awake

Being alone wanting solitude!!
Its exhausting!!


Stop it!! You are not real@love.net stop this is not who you are
Damned to god, It's me v/s you deserve@house.edu
Damned to religion, It's me v/s you
Damned to people, It's me v/s you

I want a way out from me!! stop stop stop chanting@someemail.net
hear the bluebird, ignore the monster
I am afraid of myself!! I am afraid@home.com of the monster inside me.

I hate, when I can't hold on my loneliness.
I don't know how to talk to people anymore@lively.net
I am alone and now that makes sense.

Rub your hairy balls, drink strength@homed.com beer inhale cigeratte fuck whores..
Only you, you exist! Everything around@john.net is fake...and they deserve@house.edu it.


We don't need new@gmail.com goverment..
We don't need@work.com new revolution, songs, poets. 

We don't need anything, the world had enough
We just need a space, beers, blank sheet of paper and pen,football and sex.

Being kind, wanting to do good to others is no more considered good
People believe hatred has more strength@homed.com than love...

Everything around and everyone around is taken granted.
Now, now you ask what's wrong? I say@hoko.com nothing.

Mind awake
Body asleep!!

People are just not good to eachother..
